The initial creation of this repository was made in the stepCounter repository, which for now is also public and on my page. I ended up changing the name for this because I realized the utilization of it didn't make sense usage-wise. I will eventually private the other repository and hopefully find a way to merge the two parts, displaying a complete history of my coding work.

Hence, the only changes between the two are the readability of the code, the background, and the name dictating what the counter does. Functionality remains the same.

This project uses HTML/CSS/JS.
It is my first time using JS and getting able to play around with its functionality.
