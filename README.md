The inital creation of this repository was made in stepCounter, which for now is also public and on my page. I ended up changing the name for this because I realized the utilization of my first project
didn't make sense. I will eventually private the other repository, and hopefully find a way to merge the two parts, displaying a complete history of my coding work.

This project uses HTML/CSS/JS.
It is my first time using JS and getting able to play around with its functionality.
